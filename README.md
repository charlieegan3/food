# charlieegan3-food

This project builds a Hugo site of recipes from data in [Mela](https://mela.recipes). 

The site is published to [food.charlieegan3.com](https://food.charlieegan3.com), however the site is private since it
contains some adjusted recipes from books and websites for which I do not own the original copyright.

The site is deployed on Cloudflare pages and is built on GitHub Actions using Hugo. A custom Go program is used to
build the site structure from the contents of the Meta recipe export.
